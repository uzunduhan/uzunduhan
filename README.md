### Hi I'm Duhan ðŸ‘‹


I graduated from Sakarya University Computer Engineering Department 2022. I did my internship in Simsoft Computer Technologies company as a long term (3 months). 

During my university period, I took courses to improve myself in the field of .net. In the courses I took;

-	I developed an application in layered architecture with c# form.
-	I developed a site with admin panel with asp.net core mvc.
-	I attended the .net practicum organized by patika.dev.

In addition, I am developing myself on topics such as .net6, .net7, entity framework core, angular.
