### Hi I'm Duhan ðŸ‘‹


I graduated from Sakarya University Computer Engineering Department 2022. I did my internship in Simsoft Computer Technologies company as a long term.

During my internship, I developed an attribute editing tool with c++ qt.
During my university period, I took courses to improve myself in the field of .net. In the courses I took;

-	I developed an application in layered architecture with c# form.
-	I developed a site with admin panel with asp.net core mvc.
-	I attended the .net practicum organized by patika.dev.

I have been working on 2 different projects at BirFatura since 2023. 
One of them is being developed with .net framework while the other uses current technologies and is being developed with .net architecture. 
One of them is a web application that is actively used by SMEs doing e-commerce, where they can issue invoices, manage their cargo, manage their products and do much more. 
The other project is the web API project where the invoices issued in the project I first described are sent to the GÄ°B and the processes there are managed.

I also develop myself within .net ecosystems.
